# Object Recognition
[Website](https://anwesh2410.github.io/prml.github.io/)

Our project explores various machine learning methods, including PCA, LDA, random forests,
decision trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM with RBF kernel, NN with a simple classifier, and a
self-made model, to achieve accurate object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset
